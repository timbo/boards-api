This project was built using ruby 2.5.1p57

To run this project locally install ruby 2.5.1 then run ```bundle install``` to install dependancies

This project also uses PostgreSQL so you may need to install the pg gem globally

To run the dev server run ```rake db:create``` then ```rake db:migrate``` to create the Database.

Finally run ```rails server``` to start up the server which will run on http://localhost:4000
